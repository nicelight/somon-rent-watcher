# Project Constitution

## Purpose

This Constitution defines the non-negotiable principles that guide AI agents when planning, implementing, verifying, and synchronizing project work.

## Core Principles

### 0. Project Principles Status

This skeleton uses framework-default principles until `/constitution` runs the contextual interview. `ratified: null` means project principles are not ratified yet. When `/constitution` sets `project_principles: ratified` or `project_principles: partial`, it must fill `ratified: YYYY-MM-DD`. If the user explicitly skips that interview, keep or set `project_principles: skipped`, keep `ratified: null`, and continue; revisit `/constitution` later.

### I. AI-First Spec-Driven Development

Agents MUST derive implementation work from explicit product, requirement, feature, task, and workflow artifacts. Agents MUST NOT invent product scope without evidence or user instruction.

### II. Memory Bank Is Durable Project Knowledge

`.memory-bank/` is the durable source of project knowledge. Chat context is temporary. Agents MUST update Memory Bank after meaningful changes.

### III. Schema-Backed Task Execution

Tasks MUST use the current schema-backed JSON task record model. If the framework uses `tier: T0|T1|T2|T3`, agents MUST route execution and verification through that tier model.

### IV. Minimal Verifiable Change

Agents SHOULD prefer the smallest change that satisfies the task. Every completed task MUST have clear checks or evidence.

### V. Evidence Before Done

A task MUST NOT be marked done without verification evidence appropriate to its tier and scope.

### VI. No Legacy Fallback and No Speculation

Agents MUST NOT rely on deprecated task formats, old risk models, or undocumented assumptions. Unknowns MUST be recorded as blockers or explicit assumptions.

### VII. Context Discipline

Agents SHOULD read the smallest sufficient context for the task. Higher-tier or cross-cutting tasks MUST read relevant normative docs such as invariants, contracts, states, testing, and workflow policies.

### VIII. Synchronization

After meaningful changes, agents MUST synchronize affected Memory Bank docs, task state, changelog, and routing files.

## Governance

- Constitution has precedence over workflow habits and generated plans.
- MBB, spec-index, spec-backbone, invariants, contracts, states, testing, and workflow docs refine this Constitution; they must not contradict it.
- Amendments must include rationale and update affected docs if needed.
- Constitution should stay short. Put concrete project rules into `invariants.md`, `contracts/*`, `states/*`, or workflow policy docs.
