# SDD Spec Index

## Purpose
- Keep a concise registry of existing and planned SDD specs.
- Read this index before creating new specs or doing serious design-pressure work.
- Keep readiness, open design questions, backbone status, and routing handoffs in [.memory-bank/spec-backbone.md](spec-backbone.md).
- Feature `spec_design_status` lives in feature frontmatter, not in this index.
- `/spec-design` routes below mean initial backbone creation; accepted
  backbone/shared-contract changes use `/spec-redesign`.

## Current-State Baseline Registry

These artifacts are descriptive brownfield evidence. They do not establish accepted target architecture, requirements, dependency edges or Global Backbone decisions.

| Type | Path | Status | Current-state scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| product baseline | [.memory-bank/product.md](product.md) | active as-is | Implemented product, actors, flows and constraints. |
| architecture baseline | [.memory-bank/architecture/system-architecture.md](architecture/system-architecture.md) | active as-is | C4 runtime/components, entrypoints, flows and writers. |
| integration baseline | [.memory-bank/contracts/current-integrations.md](contracts/current-integrations.md) | active as-is | Observed external boundaries and package dependencies. |
| lifecycle baseline | [.memory-bank/states/runtime-lifecycle.md](states/runtime-lifecycle.md) | active as-is | Poll, delivery, recovery and persisted-state transitions. |
| operations route | [.memory-bank/runbooks/almalinux-9-operations.md](runbooks/almalinux-9-operations.md) | active as-is | Deployment, backup, upgrade and troubleshooting routing. |
| operations route | [.memory-bank/runbooks/docker-local-operations.md](runbooks/docker-local-operations.md) | active as-is | Local Kubuntu Docker Compose build, runtime and persistent-state routing. |
| testing baseline | [.memory-bank/testing/current-coverage.md](testing/current-coverage.md) | active as-is | Existing proof paths and verification gaps. |
| development guide | [.memory-bank/guides/local-development.md](guides/local-development.md) | active as-is | Current build prerequisites and native gate. |

## Spec Registry
| Type | Path | Status | Scope | Change route |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| governance | [.memory-bank/constitution.md](constitution.md) | active | Top governing policy. | /constitution |
| invariants | [.memory-bank/invariants.md](invariants.md) | planned | Global MUST/NEVER rules when evidence exists. | /spec-init or initial /spec-design; post-acceptance /spec-redesign |
| glossary | [.memory-bank/glossary.md](glossary.md) | planned | Shared vocabulary. | /brief, /spec-init, or initial /spec-design; post-acceptance /spec-redesign |
| contract | [.memory-bank/contracts/boundary-map.md](contracts/boundary-map.md) | draft | Canonical accepted module/change-unit dependency graph and boundary contracts. | initial /spec-design, post-acceptance /spec-redesign, or /feature-to-tasks |
| testing | [.memory-bank/testing/strategy.md](testing/strategy.md) | active | Framework baseline testing policy. | explicit project-level user decision |

## Planned Specs
| Area | Expected path | Needed by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| user_scenarios | .memory-bank/user-scenarios.md | /prd-to-features, /spec-design | Create only when scenario evidence exists or gaps must be explicit. |
| core_domain | .memory-bank/domains/core-domain.md | /prd-to-features, /spec-design | Create only when domain model affects decomposition or shared design. |
| module_dependency_graph | .memory-bank/contracts/boundary-map.md | /spec-design, /feature-to-tasks | Establish accepted architecture units first, then register concrete modules, allowed dependency edges, and exact contract blocks before task handoff. |
| lifecycle_hints | .memory-bank/states/lifecycle-map.md | /prd-to-features, /spec-design | Create only when lifecycles affect feature boundaries. |
| system_architecture | .memory-bank/architecture/system-architecture.md | /spec-design | Candidate architecture hub; fill only when selected or needed by /spec-design. |
| interface_contract_specs | .memory-bank/contracts/*, .memory-bank/testing/*, and .memory-bank/runbooks/* | /spec-design, /foundation-to-tasks, /feature-to-tasks | Generate/update Interface Specification and only applicable Component/API/Event/Data contracts, protocol/agent/tool I/O, boundary compatibility, evidence/redaction, safety/security, testing, runbook, or verification contracts. Data Contract defines payloads crossing a boundary. |
| data_specs | .memory-bank/domains/* and .memory-bank/states/* | /spec-design, /feature-to-tasks | Generate/update Data Specification for internal models, DB schemas, storage/persistence/migrations, internal data formats, validation/serialization rules, lifecycle, retention, seed, or runtime data paths. |
| foundation_substrate_specs | .memory-bank/architecture/*, .memory-bank/contracts/*, .memory-bank/domains/*, .memory-bank/states/*, .memory-bank/testing/*, .memory-bank/runbooks/* | /foundation-to-tasks | Apply Architecture, Interfaces/Contracts, and Data lenses to the walking-skeleton proof path. Generate only applicable subject-based substrate contracts/specs. Product-level detail reuses or extends those paths later. |
| subject_feature_concerns | .memory-bank/contracts/*, .memory-bank/domains/*, .memory-bank/states/*, .memory-bank/testing/*, .memory-bank/runbooks/*, or .memory-bank/guides/* | /feature-to-tasks | Discover existing canonical specs first; create only missing subject-based concerns and link exact paths from features/tasks. |

## Broken / Missing Links
- TBD

## Update Rules
- Keep this file as index/registry only: types, canonical paths, statuses,
  scopes, change routes, and broken links.
- Canonical identity is the path. Do not add a separate spec key, feature owner,
  `used_by`, or reverse-usage copy; derive usage from feature/task links.
- Do not add global backbone status, backbone matrices, feature status maps, long hard rules, or open design question dumps here.
- Use [.memory-bank/spec-backbone.md](spec-backbone.md) for pre-PRD readiness, decomposition inputs, global backbone status, matrix, and handoffs.
- Use linked specs or ADRs for detailed decisions, rationale, contracts, state transitions, schemas, invariants, and testing rules.
